= TriplotBase.jl

This is a "backend" package that is used for computing contours, filled contours, and pseudocolor plots of data on unstructured triangular meshes.

Users should generally use one of the frontend packages that integrate with packages in the Julia plotting ecosystem:

* For use with Plots.jl, use https://github.com/pazner/TriplotRecipes.jl[TriplotRecipes.jl].
* For use with GR, use https://github.com/pazner/TriplotGR.jl[TriplotGR.jl].
